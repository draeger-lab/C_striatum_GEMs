# /models/

This folder contains all `**.xml` files coding for Genome Scale Metabolic Models. In this case we have four strain specific models and one model of the core metabolism for *Corynebacterium striatum*. 

The reconstructions are based on the following NCBI accessions:

**Name | DSM-number | NCBI accession | Number | Other**
--- | --- | --- | ---
FDAARGOS\_1054 | 20668 | CP066290 | 14 | ATCC 6940
FDAARGOS\_1197 | 45711 | CP069514 | 15
FDAARGOS\_1115 | 7184 | CP068158 | 16
FDAARGOS\_1116 | 7185 | CP068157 | 17

The `Cstr_core.xml` model was drafted by comparing the four strain specific models and only keeping common reactions and metabolites. It is not very developed at this point and rather conceptual then useful.
