# /models/

This folder contains all `**.xml` files coding for Genome Scale Metabolic Models. In this case we have four strain specific models and one model of the core metabolism for *Corynebacterium striatum*. 

The reconstructions are based on the following NCBI accessions. The Genome files were linked by BacDrive via DSMZ and can be downloaded either from the NCBI or PATRIC.

The `Cstr_core.xml` model was drafted by comparing the four strain specific models and only keeping common reactions and metabolites. It is not very developed at this point and rather conceptual then useful.

`Cstr_KC-Na-01.xml` was created by Tanja Urz in a research project and curated by Famke Bäuerle in a research project prior to this thesis. It provides information on the strain `KC-Na-01` which is not available for laboratory experiments but is the only strain present in the KEGG database.
