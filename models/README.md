# /models/

This folder contains all `**.xml` files coding for Genome Scale Metabolic Models. In this case we have four strain specific models and one model of the core metabolism for *Corynebacterium striatum*. 

The reconstructions are based on the following NCBI accessions:

**Number** | **Name** | **DSM-number** | **NCBI accession** | **Other**
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
14 | FDAARGOS\_1054 | 20668 | CP066290 | ATCC 6940
15 | FDAARGOS\_1197 | 45711 | CP069514 | 
16 | FDAARGOS\_1115 | 7184 | CP068158 |  
17 | FDAARGOS\_1116 | 7185 | CP068157 |

The `Cstr_core.xml` model was drafted by comparing the four strain specific models and only keeping common reactions and metabolites. It is not very developed at this point and rather conceptual then useful.
